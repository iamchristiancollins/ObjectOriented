/*
 * BookTester is our main class. Notice how it contains the main method!
 * 
 * 		public static void main(String[] args) { ... }
 * 
 * This main method should always be put into a main class.
 * 
 * Your Java program should only contain one main method, which is stored in the main class.
 * The main class might have all sorts of naming conventions:
 * 		SomethingTester.java
 * 		SomethingDriver.java
 * 		SomethingLauncher.java
 * 		or even simply named Application.java
 * 
 * Your main class will be the entry point to your Java program since it has the main method.
 * 
 * WARNING: Do not submit more than one main method in any of your assignments!
 * You simply run one Java program, and not have to run multiple Java programs.
 * 
 * Some may be wondering this: Yes, your Java program can be made of many .java files!
 * As projects become more complex, each java file should have a single, clear responsibility.
